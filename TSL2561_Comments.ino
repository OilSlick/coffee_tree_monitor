/* This driver uses the Adafruit unified sensor library (Adafruit_Sensor),
   which provides a common 'type' for sensor data and some helper functions.
   
   To use this driver you will also need to download the Adafruit_Sensor
   library and include it in your libraries folder.

   You should also assign a unique ID to this sensor for use with
   the Adafruit Sensor API so that you can identify this particular
   sensor in any data logs, etc.  To assign a unique ID, simply
   provide an appropriate value in the constructor below (12345
   is used by default in this example).
   
   Connections
   ===========
   Connect SCL to analog 5
   Connect SDA to analog 4
   Connect VDD to 3.3V DC
   Connect GROUND to common ground

   I2C Address
   ===========
   The address will be different depending on whether you leave
   the ADDR pin floating (addr 0x39), or tie it to ground or vcc. 
   The default addess is 0x39, which assumes the ADDR pin is floating
   (not connected to anything).  If you set the ADDR pin high
   or low, use TSL2561_ADDR_HIGH (0x49) or TSL2561_ADDR_LOW
   (0x29) respectively.

/* I had to change the I2C address of the sensor to get it to work with the Feather Fona. 
   Connecting the Addr pin to ground and changing TSL2561_ADDR_FLOAT to TSL2561_ADDR_LOW 
   fixed the problem for me.
